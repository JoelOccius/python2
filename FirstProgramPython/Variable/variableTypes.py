###Part 1 - Operations and Variables.
#Create a program that prints the main indicators of the OLdrink store during the last year.
#Note: do this using variables.
#Sales quantity of coca cola 150
#Sales quantity of pepsi = 130
#Unit price of coca cola 1.50
#Unit price of pepsi 1.50
#Store cost: 2500.00
#Use the block below to create all the variables you need.

#1-What was the store's revenue from pepsi?
#2-What was the store's revenue from coca cola?
#3-What was the store's profit?
#4-What was the store's margin? [Note <<Margin = profit / revenue>>] no need to format as a percentage.


#1-What was the store's revenue from pepsi?
#storecost = 2500
pepsi = 130
prix = 1.50
pepsi = prix * 130


print(pepsi)
#cocacola = 150
#revenu =('?')
#marge = storecost / pepsi
#print(pepsi)
#print(cocacola)
#print(marge)
#print(storecost)
